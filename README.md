# arleybot
my discord bot im working on

click on the "Main" button above the files and click on either "Main-Code" or "Packager-Files" to get the files to build the bot yourself if you want.

This is *another* moderation bot for discord but im making it as practice for python.

the bot is completely open source. everything i do with it will be uploaded to this repository.
